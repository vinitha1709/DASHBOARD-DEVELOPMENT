Sales Dashboard - Task Submission Report
Internship Task 3: Interactive Dashboard Development
The task involved developing an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. The dataset was first imported into Power BI, where it was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, changing data types, filtering unnecessary records, and renaming columns for clarity. Once the data was structured correctly, multiple visualizations were designed to provide meaningful insights. A bar chart was used to compare total sales across different product categories, while a line chart illustrated sales trends over time. Additionally, a pie chart displayed the percentage contribution of different regions to overall sales, and a map visualization provided a geographic representation of sales distribution. To enhance user experience and interactivity, filters and slicers were incorporated, allowing users to dynamically explore data based on product, region, or time period. Formatting elements, such as colors, labels, and tooltips, were customized to ensure readability and a professional appearance. The dashboard provides an intuitive and efficient way to analyze sales data, helping stakeholders identify trends, evaluate product performance, and make data-driven decisions. It is designed to be user-friendly, enabling seamless navigation through different insights with minimal effort. The final dashboard was thoroughly tested for accuracy and functionality before being finalized. Upon completion, the Power BI file (sales dashboard.pbix) was saved and is ready for submission. This project successfully demonstrates proficiency in data visualization and business intelligence, aligning with industry standards for sales analysis
